Firstly open cmd using run or start
Then type set path="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin"
Basically where you have installed java then jdk in it then the bin
For eg if its in E then E:\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin
Then write the java file as javac Hello_World.java 
then write java Hello_World 
and then it will run your java file in CMD.
